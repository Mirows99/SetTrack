# Project Structure Guide

This is a Next.js 15 project using the App Router, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project uses bun as package manager! MKAE SURE TO NOT USE NPM!!

## Key Files and Directories

- [app/layout.tsx](mdc:app/layout.tsx) - Main layout wrapper with providers
- [app/page.tsx](mdc:app/page.tsx) - Homepage component
- [components/](mdc:components) - Reusable UI components that are used gloably
- [lib/](mdc:lib) - Utility functions and shared code
- [hooks/](mdc:hooks) - Custom React hooks that are used globaly
- [app/auth/](mdc:app/auth) - Authentication related routes
- [app/protected/](mdc:app/protected) - Routes requiring authentication
- [middleware.ts](mdc:middleware.ts) - Next.js middleware for route protection
- @features/[feature] - this should contain any specific components, hooks, services which are just used for that feature. The root of that @features/[feature] folder should contain an index file that exports the code that is used outside the features folder


In the @app holder there should be as low amount of logic as possible. These page.tsx files are just used for routing and styling. All features should be stored elsewhere and just used as imports. 

Every page after the athorization is supposed to be in @app/protected
